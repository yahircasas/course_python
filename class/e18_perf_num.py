"""
An integer, n, is said to be perfect when the sum of all the proper divisors of n is
equal to n. For example, 28 is a perfect number because its proper divisors are 1, 2,
4, 7 and 14, and 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.
Write a function that determines whether a positive integer is perfect. Your
function will take one parameter. If that parameter is a perfect number, then your
function will return True. Otherwise, it will return False. In addition, write a main
program that uses your function to identify and display all the perfect numbers
between 1 and 10,000.
